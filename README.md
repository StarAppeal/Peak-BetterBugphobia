# Better Bugphobia

*Afraid of spiders, but you'd prefer the other creepy crawlies to look normal and not be replaced with their Bing Bong cousins?*

With this mod you can toggle each critter's appearance from normal to its bing-bong-ified version!

It overrides the bugphobia setting of Peak, and can be changed even when in-game.

## How to manually install

1. Download and install **[BepinEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_PEAK/)**
2. Download **Better Bugphobia**
3. Extract the zip and copy the contents from the `plugins` folder into `...\PEAK\BepInEx\plugins`
4. Run the game to install the mod
5. Edit the **Better Bugphobia** config  in `...\PEAK\BepInEx\config` to your liking

***Alternatively***, you can use **[ModConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/PEAKModding/ModConfig/)** to easily change the settings of the **BetterBugphobia** mod in-game!
